## Repos
> [!NOTE]
> At the time I'm writing this, both of the repos are private, so you will need an account registered to the 
> organization in order to access them. \
> These links lead to a branch of the repo, since we still haven't merged changes to the `main` branch in some repos \
**[Backend/main (already merged! Though there may be differences with the `prod` branch)](https://github.com/Biblioteca-Midossi/Backend)** \
**[Frontend/Alessandro](https://github.com/Biblioteca-Midossi/Frontend/tree/Alessandro)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently if you start the backend without a valid connection to a database, it will crash. \
> This is because it tries to create a database with syntax `create if not exists`, 
> (so it will not do anything if the database is already setup.) \
> I initially did this knowing that it wasn't a completely _good_ thing, and it will be "fixed" using an env file
> at a later moment.

## How to use Backend and Frontend
> The instruction on how to run the Backend and Frontend can be found on each repo's README.md (just scroll down after
> clicking the links above)
